# Random Quote Machine with Jquery
## Descriptions:

This was done by using a rest API created by lukePeavey
https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable#get-random-quote

Here is the end point that was use https://api.quotable.io/random. It will give you a random quote in the database everytime you call it

HTML and CSS parts were simple.

Using jQuery to connect to the API, getting the infos, then extract them, eventually display them on the web page. At first you have to refresh the page to get a new quote. Then I implemented a button, whenever you click will give out a new quote with the name of the author.
